# Unemployment-Rates-in-the-USA-
This a Data Analysis project, where I used the Fred API to extract data about unemployment in the USA. FRED stands for the Federal Reserve Economic Data, which I extracted, cleaned, and wrangled data, to be able to visualize and understand the job market and what it can affect in the us.
